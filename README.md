## ‚ö†Ô∏è Built for compatibility with Nukkit-MOT ([Link](https://github.com/MemoriesOfTime/Nukkit-MOT))
(I don't know if it would work on upstream nukkit)

## Building ‚õèÔ∏è
#### Built with Intellij IDEA internal build, add Nukkit-MOT as a library and press Ctrl+F9 to build.

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
#### For best results, turn off `xbox-auth` in `server.properties` of your development server
#### DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION (no xbox-auth makes it possible for hackers to join your server with any name)
